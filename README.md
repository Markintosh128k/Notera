# OpenNotes
OpenNotes is a revolutionary open-source web application designed for sharing educational resources across a broad range of academic disciplines, including Art, Engineering, Chemistry, Informatics, Philosophy, and more. Developed using HTML and PHP, this platform stands out by embracing a completely open and free approach to education, unlike many existing note-sharing solutions that are proprietary and often require payment.

# Key Features:

    Completely Free: OpenNotes is committed to the philosophy that knowledge should be free and accessible to all. It is a resource available at no cost for students, educators, and lifelong learners alike.

    Open Source: The open-source nature of OpenNotes means that anyone can contribute to its development, promoting a collaborative and transparent approach to building educational tools.

    PDF Sharing: Users can upload and download notes in PDF format, ensuring universal accessibility and ease of use across all devices.

    Wide Subject Range: Whether you're delving into the depths of philosophy or exploring the intricacies of engineering, OpenNotes caters to a diverse range of fields.

# Why OpenNotes?

While there are numerous platforms for sharing educational materials, many are gated communities with paywalls or are not open-source, limiting user freedom and collaboration. OpenNotes breaks down these barriers, providing a platform for those who believe in unrestricted access to education and the free exchange of knowledge. This project is for everyone who agrees that culture and education should be free of charge and always available to everyone, everywhere.
