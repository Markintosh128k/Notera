## About Notera

Notera is an open-source web application designed for sharing educational resources across a broad range of academic disciplines, including Art, Engineering, Chemistry, Informatics, Philosophy, and more. Developed using HTML and PHP, this platform stands out by embracing a completely open and free approach to education, unlike many existing note-sharing solutions that are proprietary and often require payment. Notera takes the pain out of accessing educational resources by offering a platform that is:

- **Free and Accessible**: Committed to the philosophy that knowledge should be free and accessible to all. Available at no cost for students, educators, and lifelong learners alike.
- **Open Source**: Anyone can contribute to its development, promoting a collaborative and transparent approach to building educational tools.
